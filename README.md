# Installation

</div>

**NOTES:** Currently, this has only been tested on Gnome Linux. However, it does seem to work fine for others. [**It is also possible to install with Firefox UI Fix**](#use-with-firefox-ui-fix)


#### In Firefox
- Firstly, make sure you are on the latest firefox stable version. ESR & other editions may not work as intended.
1. Visit `about:config` 
    - Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`, set it to **true**
    - While you're here, [you can enable other customizations you may want here](#customizations)
2. Visit `about:support`
3. In the `Profile Directory` row, copy the full path
    - May look something _like_: `/home/{username}/.mozilla/firefox/...`

#### Then, in a Terminal
```sh
cd #paste the path you copied before here

git clone https://codeberg.org/Freeplay/firefox-onebar.git chrome
```

#### OR, to add it manually:
1. Go to the path you copied before in your file explorer
2. If there is no `chrome` folder, create one
3. Then, inside the `chrome` folder, create a file called `userChrome.css`
    - Copy & Paste the contents of [`userChrome.css`](https://codeberg.org/Freeplay/Firefox-Onebar/raw/branch/main/userChrome.css) into the file

#### Restart Firefox, and enjoy :)

<br>

## Updating
#### If you used the Terminal Method:
```sh
cd #the path you copied before

cd chrome && git pull
```
#### If you've added it manually:
1. Go to the path you copied before
2. Enter the `chrome` folder
3. Copy & paste the contents of [`userChrome.css`](https://codeberg.org/Freeplay/Firefox-Onebar/raw/branch/main/userChrome.css) into the file

#### Then, restart Firefox.

<br>


## Customizations
1. Copy the preference name of the customization you want to enable from the table below
2. Visit `about:config`
3. Paste the preference name into the search bar
4. Click the plus button at the bottom right
#### Then, restart Firefox.

<br>

| Customization | Preference Name |
|--|--|
| Autohide **All** URLbar icons until hover | `onebar.hide-all-URLbar-icons` |
| Disable autohiding of URLbar icons (prevents movement of search bar) | `onebar.disable-autohide-of-URLbar-icons` |
| Disable truncating of `https://` | `onebar.disable-https-truncate` |
| Disable centering of URLbar on focus | `onebar.disable-centering-of-URLbar` |
| Disable single-tab styling | `onebar.disable-single-tab` |
| Hide navigation buttons | `onebar.hide-navigation-buttons` |

<br>

## Use with [Firefox UI Fix](https://github.com/black7375/Firefox-UI-Fix/tree/proton-style):

1. Install the [**Proton-style**](https://github.com/black7375/Firefox-UI-Fix/tree/proton-style#installation-guide) version of the Firefox UI fix **first**
2. Once that is done, visit `about:support`
3. In the `Profile Directory` row, click "Open Directory"
4. Enter the `chrome` folder
5. Locate & open the `userChrome.css` file
6. Copy & paste the contents of [`userChrome.css`](https://codeberg.org/Freeplay/Firefox-Onebar/raw/branch/main/userChrome.css) **at the end of the file**

#### Then, restart Firefox.
